# Multi-agent accelerator for Data Science (acnsmauricedsmas)
This library allows users to harness the power of agent-based computing using hundreds of advanced linear and non-linear algorithms.  The system can:
    1) Automatically analyse your data and perform feature selection to determine which variables are more important than others
    2) Automatically model your data for seasonality: Winter, Shoulder, and Summer seasons
    3) Automatically clean your data for outliers
    4) Automatically make predictions using the BEST algorithm (out of hundreds) that best model your data
    5) Do all this in minutes
